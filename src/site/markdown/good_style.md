# Proper writing of comments & git commit messages

### Comments
- Don't just write out simple code in english
- Don't rely on comments to make unclear code readable
- Inability to write clear comments may indicate bad code
- Good comments don't cause confusion
- Code that may appear redundant, but isn't, should always be explained
- Provide the source of your code if you got it from somewhere else
- Add comments for bugfixes
- If there are tasks that are yet to be done, mark them as TODO

### Git commit messages
- Structure your messages by using a line between its title and the summary
- Keep the messages brief and simple
- Start them with a capital letter and don't end with a period
- Use imperative mood
- Line break after 72 characters
- Describe what and why but not how
